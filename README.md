# Crunchbase Funding Analysis and Visualization

This project leverages Crunchbase data to analyze funding trends across different sectors and countries using Python and SQL. The goal is to uncover insights about startup funding, sectors with the highest funding, potential funding bubbles, and more.

## Research Questions:
1. What are the funding trends by sector and across different countries?
2. Which are the top 5 startups with the highest funding amounts in the top 10 funded sectors?
3. Which sectors have the highest average funding amounts (Top 6)?
4. Is there evidence of a funding bubble or winter in certain years?
5. What are the companies' funding size and share per their current status?
6. Which companies IPOed, and how much did they raise?
7. What are the global distributions of funding raised by companies?
8. Which companies raised significant funding but are currently shut down?

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Python**: Data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL (MySQL)**: Querying and interacting with the Crunchbase dataset.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly for visualizations.

## Summary:
The analysis provides valuable insights into funding patterns, highlighting key sectors and geographic distributions of investment. It also examines whether certain years reflect funding bubbles or crises and identifies top-performing startups, IPOs, and failed companies with significant funding.
